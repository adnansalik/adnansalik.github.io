### Hello World!
Welcome to my very first post on this blog! I'm excited to share my thoughts, experiences, and projects with you all.
I always wanted to have my personal space on the internet and I have been delaying it for too long. So here we are!

### Inspiration
I came across a blog which [Sathya](https://github.com/sathyabhat) sir is maintaining and it really heavily inspired me to start my own and this blog website is really inspired from his blog site.

### What's Next?
I plan to write about my journey as a Software Engineer, share life updates, and discuss topics that interest me. I will try to do something similar to what [Thej](https://github.com/thejeshgn) sir does in his blog which is weekly series of posts.

Feel free to reach out if you have any suggestions or topics you'd like me to cover. Stay tuned for more posts!
