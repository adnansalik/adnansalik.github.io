## a new beginning
As 2025 comes to an end I reflected on how eventful this year was. There were many big things that have happened in life this year.

### the great migration
For starters I shifted from my old 1 room apartment to a 2BHK and the shift was monumental as I moved from a calm and quiet neighbourhood(Vidyaranyapura) to a busy & noisy one (near Silk Board). This in itself is proving to be a test and I don't plan on staying here after this year.

I moved in with my family, from living alone for the past 10 years to living with people around me is a mixed bag of emotions to be honest but it has brought me closer to my siblings and parents.

### tripped af
The week long Goa trip I had with friends was an experience I will cherish forever. I always struggled to breathe under high pressure water like that of a small waterfall and that developed into a phobia but this time I decided to sit under this small waterfall we had discovered which overlooked the ocean. It took me 3-4 tries to finally get to it and sit under it but when I did, it changed me. The sheer pressure of it hitting the body and only sound you hear is the that of water crashing in your ears was something which put me in a state of trance. I honestly came out of it stronger and calmer mentally.

### workaholic
I started going to office more regularly and taking ownership of critical projects was a next gear shift in learning and workload but I enjoyed it and have plans for 2026 to improve upon some of the processess.

### the inner child
I started playing games in my free time more regularly after getting a machine that could run things. This satiated that inner child of mine which really wanted to play games as an adult after work since that is what he had dreamt of back then haha.

### longform era
I uninstalled instagram completely which was something I struggled with, I started watching longform content on YouTube but I also noticed that Reddit is slowly becoming too mainstream? I don't have a problem with that but it's just that these days the subreddit I follow are just not what they used to be, I don't get the same sense of community and belonging I used to get when I had joined back then, maybe it's just me. I will quit Reddit too this year. I started reading blogs this year which has been the most amazing experience and will continue doing so this year as well. I started reading thanks to [Ashish](https://ashishinthewild.substack.com/) for introducing me to the very first book for this year.

### communities
This year I discovered [OSM](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mapping_parties) and [bengawalk](https://www.instagram.com/bengawalk) and went to meetups and walks with amazing people with different experiences, I realised how important it is to feel that sense of belonging and going and meeting these amazing folks makes to feel less lonely and isolated especially in a city as big as Bangalore.

That's a breif gist of what this year was all about, I hope 2026 bring more control and peace.
