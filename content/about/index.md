### Bio
Adnan Saliq is a Software Engineer at Infobip, working on AWS-based integrations and serverless solutions. He enjoys solving problems at scale and is always curious about how things work under the hood.

He loves reading and often finds himself deep into an article, book, or a random Reddit thread. Adnan also volunteers for open-source and community initiatives—like mapping parties in Bangalore and public space awareness drives with Bengawalk. Given a chance, he’d love to travel the world, meet new people, and experience different cultures.

In his free time, he plays games, watches anime, or reads—basically anything that feeds his curiosity.
