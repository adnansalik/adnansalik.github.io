  abstract={The lens-free shadow imaging technique (LSIT) is a well-established technique for the characterization of microparticles and biological cells. Due to its simplicity and cost-effectiveness, various low-cost solutions have been developed, such as automatic analysis of complete blood count (CBC), cell viability, 2D cell morphology, 3D cell tomography, etc. The developed auto characterization algorithm so far for this custom-developed LSIT cytometer was based on the handcrafted features of the cell diffraction patterns from the LSIT cytometer, that were determined from our empirical findings on thousands of samples of individual cell types, which limit the system in terms of induction of a new cell type for auto classification or characterization. Further, its performance suffers from poor image (cell diffraction pattern) signatures due to their small signal or background noise. In this work, we address these issues by leveraging the artificial intelligence-powered auto signal enhancing scheme such as denoising autoencoder and adaptive cell characterization technique based on the transfer of learning in deep neural networks. The performance of our proposed method shows an increase in accuracy >98% along with the signal enhancement of >5 dB for most of the cell types, such as red blood cell (RBC) and white blood cell (WBC). Furthermore, the model is adaptive to learn new type of samples within a few learning iterations and able to successfully classify the newly introduced sample along with the existing other sample types.},

  title={ANNSESDIHM: An Artificial Neural Network based Signal Enhancement Scheme for Digital Inline Holography (DIH) Microscope},
  author={Varun Chauhan, Smit Sanghavi, Jeanie Jessica, Dongmin Seo, Sugnkyu Seo, Mohendra Roy},
  journal={IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics},
  abstract={Digital inline holography (DIH) is a proven technique for cell and microparticle analysis. This technique has been used for auto characterization of microparticles. Recently, it has been used for the characterization of complete blood count (CBC) from a whole blood sample, where the comparable results between the traditional LH750 Haematology analyser and the DIH microscope system show a correlation of 0.87 for red blood cells (RBC) and 0.92 for white blood cells (WBC). However, we observed that the DIH microscope system is very sensitive to dust and other foreign microparticles from the surrounding environment. This hampers the quality of the micrograph. Moreover, the non-uniform illumination also hinders the signal quality of the images of the cell diffraction patterns. To overcome these problems, we have investigated various neural network-based signal enhancement schemes. The results show a significant improvement in the signal quality to that of the noisy version. The study shows that convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is performing better in terms of signal improvement compared to the extreme learning machine (ELM). However, the ELM network is converging faster (within 1 epoch) compared to CNN. Also, we have studied the same with a fully connected network, which shows no improvement in the signal quality even for noises with low variance. The result demonstrates that we can use the unsupervised method, such as autoencoder (CNN) to improve the signal quality.},
