  title={Machine Learning Based Lens-Free Shadow Imaging Technique for Field-Portable Cytometry},
  author={Rajkumar Vaghashiya, Sanghoon Shin, Varun Chauhan, Kaushal Kapadiya, Smit Sanghavi, Sungkyu Seo, Mohendra Roy},
  abstract={The lens-free shadow imaging technique (LSIT) is a well-established technique for the characterization of microparticles and biological cells. Due to its simplicity and cost-effectiveness, various low-cost solutions have been developed, such as automatic analysis of complete blood count (CBC), cell viability, 2D cell morphology, 3D cell tomography, etc. The developed auto characterization algorithm so far for this custom-developed LSIT cytometer was based on the handcrafted features of the cell diffraction patterns from the LSIT cytometer, that were determined from our empirical findings on thousands of samples of individual cell types, which limit the system in terms of induction of a new cell type for auto classification or characterization. Further, its performance suffers from poor image (cell diffraction pattern) signatures due to their small signal or background noise. In this work, we address these issues by leveraging the artificial intelligence-powered auto signal enhancing scheme such as denoising autoencoder and adaptive cell characterization technique based on the transfer of learning in deep neural networks. The performance of our proposed method shows an increase in accuracy >98% along with the signal enhancement of >5 dB for most of the cell types, such as red blood cell (RBC) and white blood cell (WBC). Furthermore, the model is adaptive to learn new type of samples within a few learning iterations and able to successfully classify the newly introduced sample along with the existing other sample types.},
