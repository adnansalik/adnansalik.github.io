### What happened
I met with some friends from my very first company and it was a great experience. We met and reminised on the good old days when work and life had not hit so hard. The whole week was off and on new year's eve I decieded to stay in and celebrate as there was too much traffic outside. We made ramen and enjoyed that with Stranger Things, it was a fun eve.

### What I learned
I wanted to implement an OAuth2.0 server since a very long time and I finally did. I integreated Hubspot OAuth2.0 by creating an App on their dev portal and permissions it requires. I wrote functions in Python and used FastAPI to run the authentication backend, created a React App which called the backed services via API. A redis server temporarily stored the credentials. It was good learning and I need to read some design docs on how we can standardize it.

### What I read
I completed A Psalm for the Wild Built and honestly it was not a bad read just not something I will pick up again, it had some nice pages about what a person wants and porteays an optimistic view about it too but I found it too "privilaged" discussing the problems they discussed.
