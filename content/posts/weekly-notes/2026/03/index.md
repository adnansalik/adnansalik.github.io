### What happened
The week was eventful with new projects being assigned at work pongal holiday and catching up with collegues outside where we ate amazing mutton shawarma and kebabs. My best friend moved to Netherlands, it was a bittersweet feeling as I reminisced about us. My collegue is flying to India from Croatia so we planned his India trip a bit, I am excited to show him Bengaluru. Next week is going to be hectic as I have a ton of backlog which needs to be cleared.

### What I learned
I learned Spring Secuirty and how Authentication and Authorizations work, filter chains, CORS and CSRF. All of this is something I heard of but never fully understood but I built a samll webapp and taught myself about security concepts. I tried creating a AI video generator using Cursor as a CLI tool and was able to generate a script and a raw video. Honestly it is easy to get started and build a prototype using AI but as I made the queries complex and codebase got bigger it started losing context of what we were building so maybe not so great for production I feel.

### What I read
I completed [Tuesdays with Morrie](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6900.Tuesdays_with_Morrie) and honestly it is an amazing book a too optimistic and cliche where love triumph's all is a common theme but I believe it opened my eyes to how I see people especially old people. Morrie was a real person and I was amazed at some of the views he had regarding family, love, marriage, money and life. Highly quotable and something I will find myself coming back to. A must read.

### What am I playing
I started playing Witcher 3 DLCs which I had dropped a while back, what can I say about this game it's an amazing game and one of the best open world RPGs.
